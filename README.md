Apologies for the earlier confusion. Based on the contents of your repository, here’s a tailored README:

LitCovid Multi-label Classification

This repository provides implementations of various models for multi-label classification of COVID-19-related literature. The goal is to categorize scientific articles into relevant topics to facilitate efficient information retrieval and analysis.

Models Implemented

	•	BERT-based Model: Utilizes the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture for classification. [Notebook: bert-model.ipynb]
	•	Bi-LSTM with Word2Vec Embeddings: Combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks with Word2Vec embeddings for sequential text classification. [Notebook: bi-lstm-word2vec.ipynb]
	•	Sentence-BERT (SBERT) Model: Employs Sentence-BERT for generating sentence embeddings tailored for classification tasks. [Notebook: sbert-model.ipynb]

Repository Structure

	•	.ipynb_checkpoints/: Contains checkpoint files for Jupyter notebooks.
	•	output/: Directory designated for storing model outputs and results.
	•	.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
	•	README.md: This document.
	•	requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the notebooks.

Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahatrizvirahman/lit-covid-multilabel-classification.git
cd lit-covid-multilabel-classification


	2.	Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

	1.	Data Preparation: Ensure that your dataset is formatted appropriately for multi-label classification and is accessible to the notebooks.
	2.	Running the Notebooks: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open any of the provided .ipynb files to train and evaluate the respective models.

jupyter notebook


	3.	Model Outputs: Results and outputs will be saved in the output/ directory.
